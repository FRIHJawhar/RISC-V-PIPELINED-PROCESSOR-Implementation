# RISC-V-PIPELINED-PROCESSOR-Implementation
This project aims to implement a pipelined processor based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) using Vivado and Verilog. The RISC-V ISA is a free and open standard ISA designed for all types of computing devices, from embedded systems to supercomputers
